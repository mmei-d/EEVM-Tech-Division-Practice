    <h1> Hi everyone! </h1>
    <p> 
        My name is Munho Kim and I'm a sophomore studying accounting at the business school. <br>
        Technigcally I'm not even in Tech anymore because I transferred to the Design Division. Still lowkey loyal to tech though ^_^ <br>
        Actually though, I love hanging out with the members of tech and want to continue to do so. <br> <br>

        My CS experience has mostly been in watching scuffed YouTube tutorials and making mobile games, specifically on the game engine Godot. <br>
        I developed two mobile games with a friend from high school and am nearly done releasing both of them onto the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. <br>
        Feel free to ask me anything about mobile game dev and mining bitcoin on people's phones. 
    </p>

    <h1> Hello All! </h1>
    <p> 
        My name is Hunter Akridge and I am a junior in the college studying Cultural Anthropology and Economics :) <br>
        
        It's quite the combo, but it basically means I'm interested in person-centered and data-centered ways to understand human behavior in the digital economy. <br><br>
        
        I am in tech (<em>hopefull</em>) working primarily on UX and UX research; I'm new! It has been great to get to know the tech team, looking forward to doing that more. <br>

        I have experience doing UX research for a fitness startup and through academic projects. I'm currently gearing up to work with HCI researchers looking at algorithmic management. <br>
        Anyway, I'm always down for a chat around how tech effects humans and their communities!
